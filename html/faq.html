      <button class="accordion">Will I have to be fully undressed?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>That is 100% up to you. While it is easier for a massage therapist to work on
          your muscles if you are completely undressed, it is more important that you are
          comfortable! Note that you will be given privacy to undress and will be covered
          or, in MT speak, "draped" except for the areas being worked on.
        </p>

      <button class="accordion">I have sensitive skin, what kind of oils and lotions do
        you use?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>In Touch Massage prioritizes the use of natural, organic oils and lotions. Our
          favorites are: coconut oil, sweet almond oil, and Jojoba & aloe oil. If you have
          questions or a specific allergy, please give us a call so we can make sure to
          have what's right for you!</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Do you accept payments by insurance?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>We are currently cash & card only, for now! We understand the role insurance
          plays on a client's decision to recieve massages and are working on introducing
          payments by insurance as an option. Stay tuned!</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Does getting a massage hurt?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>That depends! A relaxation massage will be soft strokes of pressure while a
          deep tissue massage requires, well, deeper strokes. If you find your massage
          therapist is working too softly or too tough, please speak up! Your comfort is
          important.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Can I still come in if I'm sick?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Though it may seem a massage would help make you feel better, we believe rest
          and lots of fluids will help you recover faster. Please consider wether or not
          you may be contagious and stay home if you are unsure. Let's be a team and help
          prevent the spread of germs!</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">What is the cancellation and late policy?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>We require 24hrs advance notice in case of a cancellation and 15 minutes notice
          if you will be late. We understand that sometimes life happens. We will excuse
          the first incidences and you will not be charged. If however, this happens more
          than twice you will be charged the full price of the massage you scheduled.</p>
